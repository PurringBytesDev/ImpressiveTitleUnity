Mesh Conversion by Faoladh
Meshes made by ipoly3d
If you'd like to find more of ipoly3d's work, you can find them here at https://ipoly3d.com/home/

Remember to give credit when implementing these into your projects. I always recommend including a credits.txt doc
when creating your server so that people are aware of who has contributed to your work!

FOREWARNING: When adding these objects to Feral Heart, and I'm assuming any map maker, the objects may show up as large an on their sides. Always remember to scale them
down and adjust rotation to your liking, or, if possible, you can alter the material file with a scaling code if needed.(Not sure if there is a code for rotations.)

All meshes have been tested in ogremeshy but not in Feral Heart, if you come across any issues please tell me!
I hope you all enjoy this, and happy creating! :3
